Primitive Data Types:

Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. For example: 5, 3.14.
String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed within single (') or double (") quotes. For example: 'Hello', "World".
Boolean: Represents a logical value indicating true or false.
Undefined: Represents a variable/placeholder that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Null: Represents an intentional absence of any object value.
Symbol: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), represents a unique and immutable value, often used as an identifier for object properties.


Object Data Type:

Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be of any data type. Objects are used for creating complex data structures and are dynamic in nature.
Special Data Type:

Function: Functions are objects in JavaScript, but they are treated as a special data type due to their behavior of being callable. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

These data types in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning the type of a variable is determined at runtime, and variables can hold values of any type. JavaScript is also loosely typed, allowing for implicit type conversion (coercion) when operations involve different data types. Understanding these data types is essential for writing JavaScript code efficiently and effectively.
